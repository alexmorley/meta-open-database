# MOD - Meta Open Database

![Logo](logo.svg)

There are a lot of factors that come into play when choosing which technology to use. Things that directly affect your experience such as ease of install and access to all the features you want; things that effect your experience less directly such as the governance or business models of the poeple behind the tech; and finally, but importantly, how much is this going to cost, in terms of money, or increasily commonly, in terms of privacy given up.

A quick google search will help you find out something about a given produce, but as far as we can tell, there are limited databases that contain information about all the different pieces of software and hardward there are to choose from for a given task, and the links between them. We want people to be able to make informed decisions when they make these choices, but each individual will make these decisons with different weightings to different factors.

**Our aim is to create a database that will provide, and link, information about the multitude of factors that determine whether a piece of tech is right for you**. We beleive in the value of open, but ultimately we want to empower people to make the decisions that make sense for them, in each scenario. Additionally, we beleive this is the first step in creating a framework to document *exactly how valuable* open technology is to its users.
